## Usage

This GitHub Action creates a new issue based on an issue template file. Here's an example workflow that creates a new issue any time you push a commit:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/issue-on-push.yml
on: [push]
name: Create an issue on push
jobs:
  stuff:
    steps:
      - uses: JasonEtco/create-an-issue@master
        env: 
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This reads from the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` file. This file should have front matter to help construct the new issue:

```markdown
---
title: Someone just pushed
assignees: JasonEtco, matchai
labels: bug, enhancement
---
Someone just pushed, oh no! Here's who did it: {{ payload.sender.login }}
```

You'll notice that the above example has some `{{ mustache }}` variables. Your issue templates have access to everything about the event that triggered the action. [Here is a list of all of the available template variables](https://github.com/JasonEtco/actions-toolkit#toolscontext).

### Dates

Additionally, you can use the `date` filter and variable to show some information about when this issue was created:

```markdown
---
title: Weekly Radar {{ date | date('dddd, MMMM Do') }}
---
What's everyone up to this week?
```

This example will create a new issue with a title like **Weekly Radar Saturday, November 10th**. You can pass any valid [Moment.js formatting string](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/) to the filter.

### Custom templates

Don't want to use `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`? You can pass an input pointing the action to a different template:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: JasonEtco/create-an-issue@master
    env: 
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    with:
      filename: .github/some-other-template.md
```
